1. Hook up jebao fully with the correct length of airline tubing you will be using. 
2. Enter calibration mode on the Jebao up arrow choose the pump you would like to calibrate
3. Normally when calibrating a jebao it will keep track of the time it takes for 
   the pump to dispense 100ml of DI water into a graduated cylinder. It usually take 200-225 seconds.
4. Instead of dispensing 100ml only dispense 10ml using a smaller graduated cylinder. This will end up only being 18-25 seconds
5. Because you are only using 10ml to calibrate it, you need to make sure all your doses are changed accordingly.
   If you would like to Dose 1ml of fluid instead set the jebao to dose 10ml.
6. In changing the calibration you have made the jebao more fine tuned and it will pump out a more accurate 1ml
   then when set to 100ml calibration.
