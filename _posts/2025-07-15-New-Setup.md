## New Chamber Design
1. Select 8 4oz jars 
  [ChamberLink](https://www.amazon.com/Containers-Refillable-Container-Cosmetics-Supplies/dp/B0DRSCYCML/ref=sr_1_10?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zM0Av1B9l6nRAJW8Uc-oAMYLHVnpLET8Bx0g2kd3BhXoHBuufUm1e8TeVvhoDPykreXv0qLtQhpapSJajuAxUgjM7Q_15J0SVECaeQvfuDywXKp-AYAp-g35-PXXWc8aHqJACyhbgxDh1h4YLtusOA_ag9DFKrL2yCosUADRdYRznsDqMtk-5Vi6g54bP7qxjps5559UxZ_AfE8Fge6mdyG8ACTnGI7SSkwXIeH-2eQYgJfDxJgKTnPW-5R5BT4iZKwtG2DeL9LVR_vYBxUYkbdYNh6zAhWGw0MtDeUwMdU.ZrRV2c1Dv9FcrVQ4ASPFnFgCpqMU9EG4_b_DnZGQrz4&dib_tag=se&keywords=slime%2Bjars&qid=1753805089&sr=8-10&th=1)
2.For 5 out of the 8 jars they should have a lid like so
   ![2 Hole Lid Picture](https://github.com/Thatcher513/TJW_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/IMG_5912.jpg)
   These lids have a water inlet hole and a Airline hole. Both are drilled in with a 6mm bit.
3.The last 3 lids will hold the Probes 
   ![Probe Lid Picture](https://github.com/Thatcher513/TJW_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/IMG_5911.jpg)
   The two small holes are for water inlet and airline. Both are drilled with a 6mm bit.
   The three big holes are to hold Apex Probes and are drilled with a 12.3mm bit.
   In order to keep probes fixed and not touching the jar bottoms wrap with rubber bands or parafilm.
4.The side of the jar should have an outlet hole.
   ![Jar Side Profile](https://github.com/Thatcher513/TJW_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/IMG_5913.jpg)
   The hole was drilled with a 4.5mm bit and a 90 degree Airline piece used to make a downward outlet for water.

   This connection was sealed with a healthy amount of fast set acrylic glue
5. ![Chamber With Probes](https://github.com/Thatcher513/TJW_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/images/IMG_5914.jpg)
   The final Chamber set up should look like this with the probes. 
   Very important to stabilize the conductivity probe above the bottom of the chamber.
   Fill each chamber with 80mls of water.
