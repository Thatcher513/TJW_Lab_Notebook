1. Rinse all Chambers with DI water to make sure they are clean and dry.
2. Ensure that the header tank is at 60ppt or close to it within .5
2. Using a 25ml graduated cylinder add 23ml of 35ppt water to each test chamber.
3. Test the salinity of each chamber (we are using a Fisher Brand Salinity/Temp meter pen)
[Salinty Pen Link](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisher-scientific-traceable-conductivity-tds-salinity-meter-pens-2/15078202?searchHijack=true&searchTerm=15-078-202&searchType=RAPID&matchedCatNo=15-078-202)
4. Turn on Incubator so it can get to temp (25 degrees Celsius)
5. Run inlet Jebaos to assure that there are not a lot of bubbles or clogs in the lines. 
6. plug inlet water airline and airline into the top of chambers ensure that there are bubble mixing the water.

7. Wait for first 1ml dose. 15minutes after the dose check the salinity of every chamber.
Make sure air pump is turned off before checking the salinity. 
8. Let Run for 24 hours checking salinity of every chamber every hour.
9. Rinse salinity probe end with DI water between measurements dry it with a KimWipe.
10. Enter hourly measurements into a .CSV file and run a linear regression for each chamber.
